    """Planner that checks the straight-line trajectory to the goal.

    SnapPlanner is a utility planner class that collision checks the
    straight-line trajectory to the goal. If that trajectory is invalid, i.e..
    due to an environment or self collision, the planner immediately returns
    failure by raising a PlanningError. Collision checking is performed using
    the standard CheckPathAllConstraints method.
    
    SnapPlanner is intended to be used only as a "short circuit" to speed up
    planning between nearby configurations. This planner is most commonly used
    as the first item in a Sequence meta-planner to avoid calling a motion
    planner when the trivial solution is valid.
